# Project's Idea

A chatbot that allows interaction with a publicly available dataset of film/TV projects filmed in San Francisco city over the past 100 years. The augmented dataset is publicly available on SFgov.data as a CSV file.

A few examples of this chatbot's interactions from the user perspective is presented below:

👵🏽: "What are some 80s films shot in San Francsico?"

👵:"What are some films shot in the Mission neighborhood in San Francsico?"

👩🏾:"Any Charlie Chaplin films shot in San Francisco?"

**Keywords**: Gemini AI, films, history, San Francisco, public data
